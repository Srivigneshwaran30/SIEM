üìå OVERALL RESEARCH PLAN
‚úÖ We‚Äôll break this into 6 big research modules:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Log Sources
2Ô∏è‚É£ Collection Methods
3Ô∏è‚É£ Parsing & Normalization
4Ô∏è‚É£ Storage Options
5Ô∏è‚É£ Alerting / Correlation
6Ô∏è‚É£ UI / Reporting

‚úÖ For each module:
‚≠ê What is it?
‚≠ê Why is it important?
‚≠ê Real-world examples
‚≠ê Design considerations
‚≠ê Our project plan

‚úÖ Module 1: Log Sources
‚≠ê What is it?
The systems and devices that generate logs we want to monitor.

‚≠ê Why important?
SIEM‚Äôs job is to centralize logs from many sources.

Bad log coverage = missed attacks.

‚≠ê Examples:
OS logs (Linux auth.log, Windows Event logs)

Web server logs (Apache/Nginx access.log)

Firewall logs

IDS/IPS alerts

Cloud logs (AWS CloudTrail)

Application logs

‚≠ê Design considerations:
What sources will we support first?

How to handle different log formats?

‚≠ê OUR PLAN:
‚úÖ MVP focus:
‚úîÔ∏è Local file logs (auth.log, access.log)
‚úîÔ∏è Syslog input (standard for many devices)

‚úÖ Research questions to answer:

What are typical fields in these logs?

How frequently do they update?

‚úÖ Module 2: Collection Methods
‚≠ê What is it?
How the SIEM gathers logs from the sources.

‚≠ê Why important?
Without reliable collection ‚Üí no security visibility.

‚≠ê Examples:
File tailing (like tail -f)

Syslog server (UDP/514)

Agent-based collection (OSSEC/Wazuh agents)

API collection (CloudTrail APIs)

‚≠ê Design considerations:
Real-time vs batch

Scalability

Reliability

‚≠ê OUR PLAN:
‚úÖ MVP focus:
‚úîÔ∏è File tailing (watch and read new lines)
‚úîÔ∏è Basic Syslog UDP listener

‚úÖ Research questions:

How to implement tailing in Python?

How does Syslog protocol work?

‚úÖ Module 3: Parsing & Normalization
‚≠ê What is it?
Turning raw logs into structured, searchable data.

‚≠ê Why important?
Raw logs are messy.

Need to extract IPs, users, timestamps, etc.

‚≠ê Examples:
Regex parsing

JSON logs

Common Event Format (CEF)

Logstash-style pipelines

‚≠ê Design considerations:
Multiple log formats

Extensible parsing rules

‚≠ê OUR PLAN:
‚úÖ MVP focus:
‚úîÔ∏è Simple regex-based parsing
‚úîÔ∏è Store raw + parsed fields (JSON)

‚úÖ Research questions:

What fields are critical for detection?

How to make parser rules user-editable?

‚úÖ Module 4: Storage Options
‚≠ê What is it?
Where processed logs are saved.

‚≠ê Why important?
Needs to be searchable, scalable.

‚≠ê Examples:
Relational DBs (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

NoSQL (MongoDB)

Search-focused (Elasticsearch)

‚≠ê Design considerations:
Query speed

Retention policies

Storage cost

‚≠ê OUR PLAN:
‚úÖ MVP focus:
‚úîÔ∏è SQLite (simple, embedded)
‚úîÔ∏è Table for logs with raw + parsed data

‚úÖ Research questions:

Best schema for logs?

How to store JSON in SQLite?

‚úÖ Module 5: Alerting / Correlation
‚≠ê What is it?
Rules that detect suspicious patterns in logs.

‚≠ê Why important?
SIEM‚Äôs value = threat detection.

‚≠ê Examples:
Keyword matching (e.g. ‚ÄúFailed password‚Äù)

Threshold rules (10 logins in 1 min)

Correlation (multiple events over time)

‚≠ê Design considerations:
User-defined rules

Rule testing/debugging

Alert storage

‚≠ê OUR PLAN:
‚úÖ MVP focus:
‚úîÔ∏è Simple keyword/regex rules
‚úîÔ∏è CLI alert notification
‚úîÔ∏è Alerts table in DB

‚úÖ Research questions:

How to define rules in config?

How to match logs efficiently?

‚úÖ Module 6: UI / Reporting
‚≠ê What is it?
How users interact with the SIEM.

‚≠ê Why important?
No one uses a SIEM with no interface.

‚≠ê Examples:
CLI searches

Web dashboards

Alert views

‚≠ê Design considerations:
Ease of use

Security of UI

Query/filter support

‚≠ê OUR PLAN:
‚úÖ MVP focus:
‚úîÔ∏è CLI commands for:

Log search

View alerts
‚úîÔ∏è Optional Flask-based Web UI later

‚úÖ Research questions:

What CLI experience is intuitive?

How to query SQLite for logs?

‚úÖ Final SIEM Research Checklist
‚úÖ [ ] Study log sources you want to support
‚úÖ [ ] Learn file tailing in Python
‚úÖ [ ] Understand Syslog basics (RFC 5424)
‚úÖ [ ] Research Regex parsing for common logs
‚úÖ [ ] Design SQLite schema for logs + alerts
‚úÖ [ ] Define simple alert rule format (YAML/JSON)
‚úÖ [ ] Plan CLI commands for search/view
